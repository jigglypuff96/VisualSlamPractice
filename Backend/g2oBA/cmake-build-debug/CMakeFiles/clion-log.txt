CMake Warning (dev) at /snap/clion/114/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.16/Modules/FindOpenGL.cmake:275 (message):
  Policy CMP0072 is not set: FindOpenGL prefers GLVND by default when
  available.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0072" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  FindOpenGL found both a legacy GL library:

    OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so

  and GLVND libraries for OpenGL and GLX:

    OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so
    OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX.so

  OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE has not been set to "GLVND" or "LEGACY", so for
  compatibility with CMake 3.10 and below the legacy GL library will be used.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /snap/clion/114/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.16/Modules/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.cmake:47 (find_package)

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (Find_Package):
  By not providing "FindCholmod.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Cholmod", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Cholmod" with any
  of the following names:

    CholmodConfig.cmake
    cholmod-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Cholmod" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Cholmod_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Cholmod" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.


-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
